# CryptoClustering

In this challenge, Python and unsupervised learning is used  to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.
The following analysis has been done  
1.Best Value for k by Using the Original Data found  
2.The Clusters optimized with Principal Component Analysis  
3.Best Value for k by Using the PCA Data found  
4.Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means by Using the PCA Data  
5.Visualisation and Comparinsion the Results has been done  






==>The total explained variance of the three principal components is 89%

==>The best value for `k` when using the PCA data is **4** and it doest not differ from the best k value found using the original data

==>From both cluster analysis , we can clearly identify 4 clusters in each plot and no significant impact of using fewe features to cluster the data
